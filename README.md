# @forge-ahead/logging

[![License: Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

A small, opinionated, Forge-oriented wrapper around [`pino`](https://getpino.io/).
It keeps structured logging as the primary interface and adds Forge-specific
helpers that reduce log bloat, avoid customer-data leaks, and make production
debug logging opt-in through a declared Forge variable.

This package is currently private (`"private": true` in `package.json`), so use
it from this repository or a configured private workspace rather than
installing it from the public npm registry.

In a consuming Forge app with access to the package registry:

```sh
npm install @forge-ahead/logging
```

## Why this exists

Forge apps run in a cost-metered, multi-tenant runtime handling real customer
data. Logging in that environment has different defaults than a typical
Node service:

- Verbose success-path logging is a cost problem, not just noise.
- Logging raw event payloads, headers, or tokens is a customer-data leak, not
  a convenience.
- Debug logging should be an explicit, short-lived opt-in — not a code
  default that gets left on in production.

This package assumes a Forge runtime variable named `LOG_LEVEL` and resolves
it the same way in every app, so debug logging is disabled in production
unless that variable explicitly enables it. It wraps `pino` rather than
replacing it: normal app code never needs to import `pino` directly, but
[`unwrapPinoLogger()`](#api-surface) remains available as an escape hatch for
code that does.

This package does not replace Forge invocation metrics, does not invent a
general observability framework, and does not attempt to model every possible
Atlassian payload shape — its redaction and summary tools are a backstop and
an allow-list, not a guarantee.

## Usage

The package is published as ESM and targets Node 22 or newer, matching
Atlassian's recommended Forge runtime floor for new deployments.

```ts
import { createForgeLogger } from "@forge-ahead/logging";

const logger = createForgeLogger({ name: "my-forge-app" });

logger.info({ userId: "abc-123" }, "handled request");
logger.debug({}, "verbose diagnostic detail");
```

Level methods (`fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`) are
object-first: pass a metadata object as the first argument, using `{}` when
there is no metadata to attach. This package's `ForgeLogger` does not expose
pino's string-only call shape.

## `LOG_LEVEL`

`createForgeLogger()` resolves its effective level in this order:

1. A valid `LOG_LEVEL` value (`fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`,
   `trace`, or `silent`).
2. `debug`, when `NODE_ENV` is `development` and `LOG_LEVEL` is unset.
3. `info` otherwise — the safe default for both local runs and production.

An invalid `LOG_LEVEL` value falls back to `info` rather than throwing.
`resolveLogLevel()` and `getLogLevel()` expose this same resolution for
callers that need it directly, and `options.env` lets tests and scripts
inject an environment object instead of mutating `process.env`:

```ts
import { getLogLevel, resolveLogLevel } from "@forge-ahead/logging";

resolveLogLevel({ LOG_LEVEL: "debug" });
// { level: "debug", source: "LOG_LEVEL" }

getLogLevel({ LOG_LEVEL: "not-a-level" });
// "info" (falls back; resolveLogLevel() also reports invalidValue)
```

In a deployed Forge app, `LOG_LEVEL` is a non-secret Forge runtime variable.
`debug` and `trace` are meant for short-lived diagnostics, set explicitly —
not left on by default.

## Default redaction is a backstop

`createForgeLogger()` configures pino with a conservative default `redact`
list covering representative secret-shaped fields (`authorization`, `cookie`,
`token`, `password`, `secret`, and similar). Redacted fields keep their key
with the value replaced by `[redacted]`, rather than being removed.

This list is **not** a complete model of every Forge or Atlassian payload.
The primary leak-prevention mechanism is allow-list logging through Object
Summary Policies and Forge invocation summaries (below) — default redaction
is a secondary safety net for whatever those allow-lists miss.

Custom redaction paths merge with the defaults rather than replacing them:

```ts
import { createForgeLogger, withDefaultRedaction } from "@forge-ahead/logging";

createForgeLogger({ redact: ["myApp.internalToken"] });

withDefaultRedaction(["myApp.internalToken"]);
// { paths: [...defaults, "myApp.internalToken"],
//   censor: "[redacted]", remove: false }
```

## Object Summary Policies

Rich domain objects (deployments, issues, users, and so on) can be logged
through a data-only allow-list policy instead of their raw shape:

```ts
import { defineLogObjectSummaryPolicy, summarizeObjectForLog } from "@forge-ahead/logging";

const deploymentPolicy = defineLogObjectSummaryPolicy({
  kind: "deployment",
  fields: {
    deploymentSequenceNumber: "deploymentSequenceNumber",
    updateSequenceNumber: "updateSequenceNumber",
  },
  labels: {
    displayName: "displayName", // human-readable; excluded by default
  },
});

summarizeObjectForLog(deployment, deploymentPolicy);
// { kind: "deployment", deploymentSequenceNumber: 42, updateSequenceNumber: 7 }

summarizeObjectForLog(deployment, deploymentPolicy, { includeLabels: true });
// adds { displayName: "..." }
```

Fields are included by default; `labels` (human-readable, possibly
customer-identifying text) are excluded unless a caller opts in with
`includeLabels: true`. Fields missing from the source value are omitted
rather than emitted as `undefined`.

Each field selection can apply a built-in Field Transform instead of the
default `identity` summary:

| Transform | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `identity` | Summarize the value with `summarizeForLog()` (the default). |
| `redact` | Emit `[redacted]` when the value is present. |
| `tokenPreview` | String → `"123...890"`; other values → `[redacted]`. |
| `omittedShape` | Shape only: `{ omitted: true, length: N }`. |

Custom extractor callbacks are intentionally not supported — a selection is
always a field path plus, optionally, one of these four transforms.

## Forge invocation logging

`FORGE_EVENT_SUMMARY_POLICY` is a ready-made policy for Forge invocation-like
objects (resolver/web-trigger events, and similar). It works on `unknown`
input without importing a Forge TypeScript interface, and never logs `body`,
`headers`, or `contextToken` raw:

```ts
import { logForgeInvocation } from "@forge-ahead/logging";

logForgeInvocation(logger, event, "handling request");
// { kind: "forgeEvent", eventType, method, path, cloudId, ..., contextToken: "123...890",
//   headers: { omitted: true, keys: 2 }, body: { omitted: true, length: 20 } }
```

The same helper is available as `logger.forgeInvocation(event, message, options)`.
Passing `includeEventShape: true` adds the full bounded event shape — but only
when the logger's effective level is `debug` or `trace`. At `info` or higher
it instead adds `eventShapeOmitted: "requires debug or trace"`, so opting in
never silently leaks a payload in production:

```ts
logForgeInvocation(logger, event, "handling request", {
  includeEventShape: true,
});
// at info:  { ..., eventShapeOmitted: "requires debug or trace" }
// at debug: { ..., eventShape: { /* bounded, summarized event */ } }
```

## Result and Error logging

`logResult()` and `logError()` integrate directly with
[`@forge-ahead/errors`](https://github.com/ibuchanan/forge-ahead-errors),
rather than only accepting structural error payloads:

```ts
import { ok, StandardError } from "@forge-ahead/errors";
import { logResult } from "@forge-ahead/logging";

const notFound = StandardError.getOrDefault(404).error("not found");

logResult(logger, notFound);
// Err: logs at "error" by default — only approved ProblemDetails fields
//   (type, title, status, detail, timestamp, instance)

logResult(logger, ok({ deploymentSequenceNumber: 42 }));
// Ok: logs at "debug" by default — a generic { ok: true } marker,
//   never the raw value
```

Both directions never log the raw value by default. `summarizeOk`/`summarizeErr`
options add caller-provided metadata on top, after that normal handling:

```ts
logResult(logger, result, {
  summarizeOk: (deployment) => ({
    deploymentSequenceNumber: deployment.deploymentSequenceNumber,
  }),
  summarizeErr: (problem) => ({ retryable: problem.status >= 500 }),
});
```

`logError()` is the equivalent helper for `catch` blocks, normalizing any
thrown value through `@forge-ahead/errors`' `toProblemDetails()`:

```ts
import { logError } from "@forge-ahead/logging";

try {
  await risky();
} catch (thrown) {
  logError(logger, thrown);
}
```

Non-`ProblemDetails` `Error` instances also get an `errorName` field. Stack
traces are included only when the logger's effective level is `debug` or
`trace`. `logger.result(result, options)` and
`logger.errorResult(error, options)` are the equivalent logger methods.

## Debug Probe

A Debug Probe is a pass-through logging convenience for wrapping a value or
an application expression: it returns the original value (or preserves the
original async fulfillment/rejection), while emitting a bounded, namespaced
log record as a side effect. It only ever logs at `debug` or `trace`, never
at the package's default `info` level, so it is safe to leave in code without
a separate cleanup pass:

```ts
import { logProbe } from "@forge-ahead/logging";

const total = logProbe(logger, "cartTotal", computeTotal(cart));
// pass-through: `total` is exactly computeTotal(cart)'s return value

const user = await logProbe(logger, "fetchUser", () => fetchUser(id));
// pass-through: fulfills with the resolved user, or rethrows the same
// rejection — either way, one debugProbe record is logged after settling
```

Successful probes log `{ debugProbe: { label, value } }`, where `value` is
produced with `summarizeForLog()`. Rejected async work or a probe thunk that
throws synchronously logs `{ debugProbe: { label, error } }` instead, using
the same approved Problem Details-style error fields as `logResult()`/
`logError()`, and still rethrows or rejects for the caller — a probe never
swallows an error, it only adds a log record alongside it.

A caller-supplied label is required, and probes accept one value at a time —
pass an object when inspecting several values together. Pass a thunk
(`() => expression`) rather than a bare value when the expression might throw
synchronously, so the probe can log the failure before rethrowing it:

```ts
logProbe(logger, "cartTotal", computeTotal(cart), { level: "trace" });

logProbe(logger, "cartTotal", computeTotal(cart), {
  metadata: { cartId: cart.id },
});

logProbe(logger, "cartTotal", computeTotal(cart), {
  metadata: () => ({ cartId: cart.id }), // computed only if the level is enabled
});
```

`metadata` may be a plain value or a zero-argument function; when it's a
function it is only called if the requested probe level is enabled, so
expensive probe-only diagnostics don't run in production. The probed value or
thunk itself always runs regardless of level — a probe never makes
application behavior conditional on logging.

`logger.probe(label, valueOrThunk, options?)` is the equivalent logger
method, including on `child()` loggers, where emitted records carry the
child's bindings.

Debug Probe is a development-time convenience, distinct from [Demo Narrative
Logging](#demo-narrative-logging): a probe wraps real application code and
preserves its behavior, while Demo Narrative Logging is example-only
storytelling with no pass-through value.

## Demo Narrative Logging

Demo Narrative Logging is for **example code**, not production apps: it lets
a static repo "tell its story" through ordinary structured `ForgeLogger`
records, so a demo reads clearly even without live narration. It is kept
behind an explicit `@forge-ahead/logging/demo` subpath rather than the root
package, so demo-only imports are easy to spot in review and never end up in
production code:

```ts
import { createForgeLogger } from "@forge-ahead/logging";
import { createDemoNarrative } from "@forge-ahead/logging/demo";

const logger = createForgeLogger({ name: "onboarding-demo" });
const demo = createDemoNarrative(logger, { storyId: "onboarding" });

demo.step("user signs up");
demo.step("welcome email queued", { templateId: "welcome-v2" });
```

Every step logs at `info` through the supplied logger, with `kind:
"demoNarrativeStep"`, `demoOnly: true`, the narrative's `storyId`, and an
automatically incrementing `stepNumber`:

```json
{ "level": 30, "kind": "demoNarrativeStep", "demoOnly": true, "storyId": "onboarding", "stepNumber": 1, "msg": "user signs up" }
```

Step metadata is optional — message-only steps are valid — and, when
supplied, is summarized and redacted the same way as everywhere else in this
package, via `summarizeForLog()`. Use a distinct `storyId` per narrative
thread; nested or child narratives are not supported in this version.

## API Surface

- `createForgeLogger(options?)` returns a `ForgeLogger`; `unwrapPinoLogger(logger)`
  exposes the underlying pino instance for interop.
- `resolveLogLevel(env?)` and `getLogLevel(env?)` resolve `LOG_LEVEL`/`NODE_ENV`
  without logging as a side effect.
- `withDefaultRedaction(redact?)`, `DEFAULT_REDACT_PATHS`, and
  `DEFAULT_REDACTION_CENSOR` back the default redaction backstop.
- `summarizeForLog(value, options?)` produces JSON-safe, bounded,
  depth/size-limited summaries of arbitrary values.
- `defineLogObjectSummaryPolicy(policy)` and
  `summarizeObjectForLog(value, policy, options?)` implement Object Summary
  Policies and the `identity`/`redact`/`tokenPreview`/`omittedShape` Field
  Transforms.
- `FORGE_EVENT_SUMMARY_POLICY`, `summarizeForgeInvocation(event, options?)`,
  `logForgeInvocation(logger, event, message?, options?)`, and
  `logger.forgeInvocation(...)` cover Forge invocation logging.
- `logResult(logger, result, options?)`, `logError(logger, error, options?)`,
  `logger.result(...)`, and `logger.errorResult(...)` cover Result/Error logging,
  integrated with `@forge-ahead/errors`.
- `logProbe(logger, label, valueOrThunk, options?)` and `logger.probe(...)`
  implement Debug Probe.
- `createDemoNarrative(logger, { storyId })` from the `@forge-ahead/logging/demo`
  subpath implements Demo Narrative Logging; it is not exported from the root
  package.
